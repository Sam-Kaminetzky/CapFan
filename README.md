# CapFan
Capacitive sensor and temperature sensor controlled Arduino fan project. 

Uses a capacitive sensor and temperature sensor to control the speed of a fan. The speed of the fan decreases when a hand is positioned closer to the capacitive sensor. When the capacitive sensor is touched, the fan's on/off state will be toggled. When the temperature of the environment is above a certain value, the fan is turned on automatically. The fan turns off when the temperture is below said value. The LCD screen displays the current speed of the fan and the current temperture of the environment.

Performed by Zichao Chen, and Samuel Kaminetzky, as part of a project at the University of Washington, for EE 474 under Vikram Iyer.
